# 1000 Trade Value Comparison:
# Wealth Creation =			1000 energy		
# Consumer Benefits =		 500 energy															 250 consumer goods
# Marketplace of Ideas =	 500 energy																																					 250 unity
# Colleganza =				 200 energy		  25 minerals		  25 food		  10 alloys		 200 consumer goods		  20 physics		  50 society		  20 engineering		 200 unity
# dan's notes
#Colleganza = 200 + 50 + 25 + 50 200 + 75 (stats taken from other trade pols) + 75 + 75 + 400 = 1350?? buts its a sceret civic and if you have too much of a rescource its worth alot less
#trade versions are 2.4x of normal
#trade colleganza = 600 + 100 + 50 + 125 + 300 + 300 + 300 + 600 = 2775 keeps step with the trade league changes (2400) but still is slightly better as its a secret civic
