 origin_hive_infestor:0 "Infector swarm"
 origin_hive_infestor_effects:0 "Homeworld is a §Y$pc_hive$§! (Size: £planetsize£ §Y20§!)\nConsciousness of this swarm has strong connection with biomass that cover its homeworld therefore, drones produce and consume resources on §G10%§! more effectively on §Y$pc_hive$§!, but they are almost not capable on any other worlds. Allows §YInfect§! planets with special decision to gathering more resources from them."
 origin_hive_infestor_desc:0 "From the very beginning, this swarm spread its own biomass on the planet, which supported its existence and helped in its development. In the end, the symbiosis of biomass and swarm led to the fact that the mind of the swarm merged with the biomass and is no longer able to exist outside of its distribution area."
 START_SCREEN_INFEST:0 "From the very beginning, our consciousness has been in a symbiotic relationship with the biomass. We fed it, allowing it to grow on the surface of the entire planet. After absorbing the entire ecosystem of the planet, we turned our attention to the stars. By opening the first hyperdrive, we were able to spread the biomass to other planets. We will continue its growth and our development throughout the galaxy."
