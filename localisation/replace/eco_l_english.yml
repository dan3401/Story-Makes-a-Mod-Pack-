 eco_gaian.100.desc:0 "Gaian ruins can be found in every region on [From.Planet.GetName], but the highest concentration of structures can be found in a remote location near the North pole of the planet. Surprisingly, the architecture appears to be suited for warm climates with many of the interior spaces exposed to the elements. It was commonly assumed that the North pole was cold during the time of the Gaians, so archaeologists have landed here believing that it may have been built in the period leading up to their demise."

 eco_gaian.110.desc:0 "Establishing a base to study the Gaian civilization has proved to be more controversial than expected. Preliminary explorations into the region have revealed a culture of great wealth and comfort. Archaeologists are divided on whether to venerate or condemn the obscene excess of this extinct race. Some argue that their study into the Gaians should be for the recreation of such a dazzling society, while others insist that we are learning from the mistakes of the past. The inhabitants of [From.Planet.GetName] have quickly made the Gaians a part of their cultural identity, so this expedition is anticipated to become mired in controversy."
 # Gaian Arc 3

 eco_gaian.120.desc:0 "A wealth of knowledge about the history of the Gaians has become available with the first major expedition complete. The Gaians were an incredibly market driven society focused on using wealth to generate even more wealth. They built a great society of investment and support in the lowest members of society and the natural environment to maximize the economic value produced at the top. The natural riches of [From.Planet.GetName] eventually propelled the Gaians into a post-scarcity economy where war and poverty could no longer exist. Yet despite their efforts to elevate their society by raising it from the bottom, the Gaians faced total ruin over the course of just a few decades as their society began to unravel - from the bottom up."
 # Gaian Arc 4

Through technological innovation, the Gaians had maximized the potential output of [From.Planet.GetName], but hadn't adjusted their economies to reflect the fact that further growth was no longer possible. By the time this shift in practices was necessary, the Gaians had lost the language to speak or even think about reduction or shrinkage in demand. Even as the world burned around them, they continued to consume more and more. With no habitable worlds to expand to, the Gaians gave up on the idea of saving their homeworld and started investing all their energy into looking for other worlds to terraform. It would be their last desparate act as an organized society."
 # Gaian Arc 5
 eco_gaian.140.name:0 "Divisions Then and Now"
 eco_gaian.140.desc:0 "Records from the twilight of the Gaian civilization are sparse and unorganized. The ancient inhabitants of [From.Planet.GetName] broke into endlessly fracturing splinters of their former global society, each fighting for ideals that it had no hope of actualizing. Had they only acted a few decades earlier they might have maintained their utopia almost indefinitely. Some records hint at a city in the post-apocalyptic world where one such splinter group fled to the stars in hope of finding another home. Similarly, the archaeologists studying the Gaians have divided into different groups speculating on whether or not the Gaian market was really to blame for the destruction of their civilization or if their technology unintentionally destroyed [From.Planet.GetName]."

A city was found at the specified location, but if there was a space project there, then it has been erased by time. Similarly, many are skeptical that the Gaians continued to consume more and more even as their environment could not keep up with demand! Surely no society as advanced as the Gaians would make such an obvious mistake. If there was another reason for their destruction, then it has also been lost to time. Regardless of their fate and what led to it, the different factions of the archaeological teams investigating the Gaians have come together to share some of their technological innovations with the world that they've left behind."
