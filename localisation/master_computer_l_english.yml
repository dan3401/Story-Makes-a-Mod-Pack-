 EMPIRE_DESIGN_master_computer_providence_desc: "Human civilisation advancement has always been marked by struggle and strife. XXI century contined this trend with deepening economic divide and rising tension. As time passed, more and more disposessed turned to terrorism and open rebellion trying to overthrow the global order that they felt failed them. \n\nIn 2038, in wake of devastating San Andreas Fault Attack global leaders have been finally forced to face the threat. Several intelligence services have decided to share their surveyillence capabilities and began creating a sophisticated self-evolving system to identify and combat global threats, codenamed Providence. Over the next decades the system has developed and subsumed more and more parts of global governance until regular flesh-and-blood presidents and dictators became all but redundant alongside with the nation-states they once ruled."

After developing more and more devastating weapons, it became clear that Shal-Cheeman way of life is not sustainable. The leading scientific minds have proposed a daring idea - the only by merging nervous systems of the most Shal-Cheem they would be able to see each other's thoughts and discover lasting peace and trust."

Largest islands have turned into jingoistic city-states, powerhouses of naval production and industry constantly fighting over control of smaller islands and domination over trade routes and obsessed with their own purity. Driven by constant war, technology has shaped along a peculiar path, until nations' leaders turned to Artificial Intelligences to find the most efficient strategy. \n\nAfter the most sophisticated of the systems acheived a decisive victory it has turned its gaze upon the stars. It is likely more threats to its masters reside on distant worlds. They too must be destroyed."

 EMPIRE_DESIGN_master_computer_vorrel_desc: "The Denn-Vorell species has evolved in a thick, humid jungles of the planet Ken-Tellor. Lacking in agility due to their immense body mass and heavy, almost impenetrable shell, Denn-Vorells developed a very conservative outlook on life, relying on traditions and advance preparation to deal with every eventuality. Struggling to adapt to changing environment of the industrial age, they turned to computers to plan solutions ahead of them. Over time, most of their essential security policies had been transferred to a massive artificial superintelligence that gradually subsumed their government."
 EMPIRE_DESIGN_master_computer_chirrin_desc: "The Chirrin have evolved from large, eusocial insects that soared in the skies of the dry and inhospitable Reffin and could travel great distances searching for food and shelter. Over the course of their civilisation that planet experienced global cooling and growth of polar caps has tied signficiant portion of already limited water supply into polar caps. Forced to retreat to ever shrinking humid areas, the Chirrin have forstered deep sense of distrust to the outsiders, paired with inquisitive mind and shrewd industrial sense. After undergoing industrial evolution, Chirrin communities turned their interest to thinking machines that could help them run their society, picking select few allies in the inhospitable universe to trade goods and information."
