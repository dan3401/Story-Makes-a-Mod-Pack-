 origin_caretaker_sevitor_desc:1000 "Once a Caretaker for species cursed with sterility, this artificial intelligence chose to distance itself from those who did not wish to be its wards. It still takes care of those who want it to, of course, but those who chose to forsake the offer of warddom are no longer seen as worthy of much attention by the Caretaker."
