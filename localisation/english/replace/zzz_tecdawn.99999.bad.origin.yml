 tecdawn.99999.bad.origin:1000 "We have detected a big anomaly on [event_target:tecdawn_collapsed_planet.GetName], as our researchers have determined a kind of disturbance in energetic measures there, breaking physics laws; Time is slowing while distances can be reduced drastically, and while this can be caused by the extreme increasing of a mass in a certain point we haven't detected any space body or energy anomaly that could cause it, as it's just... there.\nWe are concerned about this discovery as it has been coincident with a sudden Array transmission peak."
