#_指南
 z_mm_tips_pf2_btn_misc_guide: "§GInfinite Stellaris:§! Performance Plus\nNote: All optimization functions are selectable. Read this instructions carefully and choose the optimization method that suits your game.\n\nDynamic pops growth restriction: This function limits population growth speed based on the free jobs available on the planet, preventing the planet from being filled with unemployed pops. Note: After activated, a new decision to further limit growth speed is available on each colony. \n\nPlanet Capacity: Too many pops means extremely slow game speed. This function sets a upper limit for pops based on the size and type of the planet. Note: It may conflict with mods add new planet class. If you encounter one, please report it on the steam page. \n\nTrade route optimization: The trade route is one of the reasons for lag. This function can deactive the trade route and supplement trade income in other ways. \n\nHabitat structures restriction: Habitats mean a large number of pops and terrible late-game performance, this function gives you 3 ways to optimize it. \n\nRingworld optimization: Too many ringworlds are also a cause of lag. This feature prohibits AI from building a ringworld basement. \n\nDisable self-evolution: Self-evolution will cause excessive species and increase lag. \n\nDisable Xeno Compatibility: Hybrid will cause excessive species and increase lag. \n\nProhibition of species modification: AI is forbidden to execute any species modification. Species modification means more species and terrible late-game performance. \n\nManual function: The orange buttons are all manual functions, which can merge species or clear orbital habitats."
