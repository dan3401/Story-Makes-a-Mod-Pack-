NEED HELP

Gene modification points {
	Why don't people get them when they should?
	Robots work, but biologicals don't?
}

Double-check mod 'More AI Personalities' {
    These personalities were made with only the vanilla ethics and civics in mind
    Update some / write new ones so that the whole roster can show up
}

Name list "name_list_}" {
    What the heck is this?
    Where did it come from?
}

"Necrophyte shortage"??? {
    I have no idea what could be causing this
}

Policy "Purge" > "Allowed" {
    For some reason everyone can purge, even fanatic xenophiles
    I've checked and double-checked the code, but I can't see what's wrong
}
